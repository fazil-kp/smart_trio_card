# Smart Trio Card

A Flutter package for creating an **interactive stacked trio carousel** with smooth animations.  
It displays exactly **three widgets** at a time â€” a front card, a left card, and a right card â€”  
and allows rotation via swipe gestures, autoplay, or programmatic control.

## âœ¨ Features
- Displays **three cards** stacked in a carousel layout.
- Supports **autoplay**, **user swipe**, and **manual control**.
- Customizable card height, width, opacity, and scaling.
- Works with any widget (images, custom cards, videos, etc.).
- Uses `Overlay` for smooth animations without rebuilding the background.
- Controller for programmatic navigation (`next()`, `previous()`).
